# City Explorer

**Author**: Luke Rogers
**Version**: 2.1.0

## Overview

This app gives a user the ability to type in any city within the United States. A map of the city, its coordinates, a 5 day weather forecast, and movies associated with the city are returned to the user.

## Getting Started

The user must create a React app, connect the app to the City Explorer API, and format the page with a form, that once clicked on, grabs a table of information and an image from the API. The user should also create an error message that displays when an error occurs. The user should then create a server that contains the weather data and movie data and connect that server to the front end application.

## Architecture

Techonologies: React, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, Axios.
